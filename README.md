# removefakefollowers

## How to Use
Clone to working directory
Run `npm install` to install dependencies (If you do not have Node.js or NPM installed you will need to install them)
Create a `.env` file to store your API credentials
Run `npm start` to start the program
If you choose to block users via API no file will be created. If you print to file, a file will be created and it will be overwritten if it already exists.
