## How to Use
1) Clone to working directory
2) Run `npm install` to install dependencies (If you do not have Node.js or NPM installed you will need to install them)
3) Create a `.env` file to store your API credentials
4) Set options in `index.js`
5) Run `npm start` to start the program

If you choose to block users via API no file will be created

If you print to file, a file will be created and it will be overwritten if it already exists. You must take this list to your Account Settings and import the list of ids to block manually.
